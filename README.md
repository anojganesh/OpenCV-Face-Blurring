# Face Censoring in Video

This project demonstrates how to detect faces in a video and blur those regions. It uses OpenCV for video processing and face detection using a Haar Cascade specifically trained for frontal face detection.

## Features

- Loads a video file.
- Detects **frontal faces** in each frame of the video.
- Applies a blur effect to the detected faces.
- Saves the processed video with blurred faces to a new output file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
